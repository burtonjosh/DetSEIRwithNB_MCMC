# Welcome to the DetSEIRwithNB_MCMC repository

This repository is used to make predictions on the number of occupied hospital beds (ICU and non ICU), deaths related to, and cases of, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic localised to the UK. It fits NHS situational report data on a region by region basis to a deterministic SEIR model using the Metropolis-Hastings random walk algorithm.

## Dependencies (tested on Ubuntu 18.04):

- Julia (https://julialang.org/)

For any questions concerning this repository, please email Joshua Burton at `joshua dot burton at manchester dot ac dot uk`
